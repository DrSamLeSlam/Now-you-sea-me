  "body": "\r\nHello! We are 3 students from Woodrow Wilson High School in SW Portland. Our names are Cade Conklin, Sam Nathanson, and Ethan Holmgren. We coded our game, Now You Sea Me, in Java from scratch on the Eclipse platform.\r\n\r\n### The Game!\r\nThe Game is just hide and seek, but two player! The first player needs to hide in the game, and the second will seek, but make sure the second player isn't watching the hider or else the game might not be much fun! When the first player hides, they leave behind a translucent version of themselves at the spot where they clicked, it's harder to find than it looks!\r\n\r\n### The Controls\r\nTo move, use the mouse, and the diver will follow the cursor. For the hider, clicking will hide you, and the seeker needs to be within a certain distance and click in order to find and win. \r\n\r\n### How to Win\r\nFor the hider, you win if the seeker can not find you within the given time limit, and for the seeker, you just win if you can find the hider at all!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
